// Problem of week 3 day 4  is "Dedupe":
// Deduplication, or deduping for short, is the process of removing identical entries from two or more data sets such as mailing lists.

// Today's algorithm is about "deduping" of an array of numbers. 

// First, to make it easy, we do it for a sorted array. Then, we will dedupe an unsorted array.

// Example for deduping sorted array: 
// dedupe of  [ 1, 1, 1, 3, 4, 4, 4, 7, 8, 8 ] will be  [ 1, 3, 4, 7, 8 ]

// Example for deduping of unsorted array:

// Dedupe of [ 3, 4, 1, 4, 4, 5, 3, 4 ] will be [ 1, 3, 4, 5 ]

// Hint: For solving unsorted  arry use object. (edited)
